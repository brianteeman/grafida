/**
 * Reads the OS clipboard as plain text, for the editor's "paste as plain text"
 * shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V).
 *
 * ⚠️ **Why this is not done in JavaScript.** The obvious implementation is
 * `navigator.clipboard.readText()`, and it is the wrong one on the webviews we
 * ship. WKWebView treats an unprivileged clipboard *read* as something the user
 * must confirm: it beeps and puts a one-item "Paste" callout on screen that has
 * to be clicked, which turns a keystroke into a mouse trip and makes the
 * feature slower than the menu it replaces. The clipboard is not a web resource
 * on a desktop app — it belongs to the user's session, which the backend is
 * already part of — so we read it the same way we read the OS appearance and
 * the secret store: a short-lived subprocess, no prompt, no callout.
 *
 * Returns **null** when the clipboard could not be read at all and the **empty
 * string** when it is genuinely empty; the caller must not conflate them (an
 * empty read is a no-op paste, an unreadable one is worth reporting).
