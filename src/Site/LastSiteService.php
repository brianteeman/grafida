 *
 * This lives server-side (in the generic `settings` key/value store) rather than
 * in the SPA's `localStorage`, because Boson's webview does not persist
 * `localStorage` across an app restart — the very moment the preference needs to
 * survive. The SPA still validates the id against the current site list, so a
 * stale id (e.g. a since-deleted site) simply falls back to the first site.
