/**
 * The per-site "Site uses Unicode Aliases" setting (gh-61).
 *
 * Joomla's `unicodeslugs` Global Configuration option decides which of the two
 * alias algorithms a title is slugified with, and reading it over the API needs
 * `core.admin` — which a token belonging to anything less than a Super User does
 * not have. Before this, such a site silently fell back to "off" and a Greek or
 * Chinese title produced a timestamp alias with no explanation. So the value is
 * a **tri-state**: `auto` (ask the site, the previous behaviour and still the
 * default) plus a straight `yes`/`no` the user can state themselves.
 *
 * There is deliberately no enum: the value is a plain TEXT column, may be NULL
 * on rows written before the migration, and is echoed to the SPA as-is.
