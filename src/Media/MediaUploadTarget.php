/**
 * Works out where a published article's images are uploaded to: which Media
 * Manager filesystem (adapter) and which folder inside it (gh-57).
 *
 * ⚠️ **An upload must name its adapter, because Joomla's idea of the default one
 * is not "the images folder".** `ProviderManagerHelperTrait::getDefaultAdapterName()`
 * resolves a colon-less path against `local-` + com_media's **`file_path`**
 * parameter, which a stock Joomla install stores as `files` (see `base.sql`), and
 * `plg_filesystem_local` ships adapters for both `images` and `files` — so on a
 * default site an unqualified path lands in `files/`, not `images/`, and only a
 * site that has *removed* the `files` adapter falls through to the "first
 * available local adapter" everyone assumes is the rule. Joomla's own image
 * fields (`MediaField`, TinyMCE's upload dir) use the separate `image_path`
 * parameter, i.e. `images` — which is what an article's pictures belong in, so
 * that is what we resolve to when the user has expressed no preference.
 *
 * Both halves are per-site settings (`sites.media_adapter` / `sites.media_folder`);
 * an empty adapter means "resolve automatically" and an empty folder means
 * {@see DEFAULT_FOLDER}.
