/**
 * Serves the documentation bundled in `docs/` to the in-app Help screen.
 *
 * The same Markdown files are published verbatim as the project's GitHub wiki
 * (see `scripts/sync-wiki.sh`), so the *wiki* — the dumber of the two consumers
 * — dictates the source format and this class adapts to it rather than the
 * other way round:
 *
 * - One flat directory, one file per page, the file name being the wiki page
 *   name (`Custom-API-Access.md` → the wiki's "Custom API Access" page).
 * - **No YAML front matter**, which a GitHub wiki renders as visible junk. Page
 *   metadata lives in `docs/_manifest.json` instead — which also spares us
 *   `glob()`, a function the phar stream wrapper cannot serve, so the docs can
 *   be read straight out of the compiled binary with no extraction step (see
 *   {@see \Grafida\Support\Resources::docsDir()}).
 * - Links between pages are written the way the wiki resolves them, as a bare
 *   relative page name (`[Custom API access](Custom-API-Access)`). Nothing in
 *   this app can follow such a link, so {@see self::rewriteReferences()}
 *   annotates every anchor with the attributes the SPA's click handler reads.
 *
 * Rendering is GitHub-Flavoured Markdown with raw HTML **allowed**, which is
 * what makes the two consumers agree: the GFM extension bundles
 * `DisallowedRawHtml`, so exactly the tags GitHub neutralises (`<script>`,
 * `<iframe>`, `<style>`…) are escaped here too, while the ones a manual
 * legitimately needs (`<kbd>`, `<sub>`…) survive in both places. The content is
 * ours and ships inside the binary; it is not user input.
