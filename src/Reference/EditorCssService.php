/**
 * Loads a site template's editor.css, rebases its relative url() references to
 * absolute URLs, and caches the result. On any failure (including a 5 second
 * timeout) it falls back to the cached copy; if there is none, it returns null
 * so the editor simply runs without site-specific styling.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The cache is read first and the network is not touched at all when it
 * hits.** Finding the stylesheet is expensive — {@see TemplateDiscovery} costs a
 * styles-API call plus a home-page fetch, and {@see self::candidatesFor()} then
 * walks up to eight URLs at 5 seconds apiece — and this used to be paid on
 * *every* editor open, in front of the user, before TinyMCE was created. It is
 * now paid only when {@see self::load()} is asked to `$refresh`: when a site is
 * connected or edited, and on a metadata refresh (manual or TTL-driven), which
 * is where every other per-site cache is warmed too.
 *
 * A **miss is cached as well** — an empty string, meaning "we looked and this
 * site has no editor.css we can reach" — or a site whose template ships none
 * would pay the whole candidate walk forever. It is written only when the site
 * actually answered: if every candidate threw, the site was unreachable and
 * nothing was learned, so the next open is free to try again.
