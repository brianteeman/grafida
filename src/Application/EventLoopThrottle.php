/**
 * Keeps the Boson event loop from burning a CPU core while the app sits idle.
 *
 * Boson's `Application::run()` is a busy loop: it calls `$poller->next()` for as long as the app
 * lives, and the stock poller separates two iterations by `usleep(1)` — one microsecond. Every
 * third iteration crosses FFI into `saucer_application_run_once()`, which pumps the whole native
 * event loop (on macOS, a full `-[NSApplication nextEventMatchingMask:…]` round trip). At tens of
 * thousands of iterations a second that costs about **half a core, permanently**, with the window
 * doing nothing at all — measured at ~49% of a core on an M5 with Grafida idle on the Articles
 * screen, against 0.0% for the WebKit content process that was actually showing it.
 *
 * This decorator adds a second sleep after the inner poller has run, so the loop spins a few
 * hundred times a second instead of tens of thousands. That is still far above any rate a person
 * can perceive — a native event is picked up within about {@see self::IDLE_SLEEP_US} × 3
 * microseconds, i.e. well under one frame at 120 Hz — and it takes the idle cost to under 1% of a
 * core.
 *
 * The one thing a fixed sleep would slow down is a *burst* of `boson://` requests, where each
 * round trip would pay the same delay again. So the throttle is dropped for
 * {@see self::BUSY_WINDOW} seconds after every {@see wake()} call: `index.php` wakes it each time
 * the front controller answers a request, which means a page's worth of API calls runs at the
 * upstream loop's full speed and only a genuinely quiet app is throttled.
 *
 * It is a decorator rather than a replacement because the poller the parent builds carries a
 * deferred task that flips `Application::$isRunning` and fires `ApplicationStarted` — a closure
 * over state a subclass cannot reach ({@see \Boson\Application::$isRunning} is `private(set)`).
 * Wrapping keeps that, and keeps us out of Boson's `@internal` microtask bookkeeping entirely.
