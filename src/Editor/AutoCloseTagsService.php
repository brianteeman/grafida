/**
 * Stores how aggressively the source-code editor closes HTML tags for you.
 *
 * CodeMirror's `closetag` addon has two independent halves, and this preference
 * is a three-way choice rather than an on/off toggle because they are genuinely
 * useful separately (gh-52):
 *
 * - {@see self::FULL} — both halves. Typing the `>` of `<p>` inserts `</p>`,
 *   and typing `</` completes the nearest open tag.
 * - {@see self::CLOSING} — only the `</` completion. This is the mode for
 *   someone editing existing markup, where an auto-inserted closing tag is
 *   almost always something to delete again, but completing a closing tag you
 *   asked for by typing `</` never gets in the way.
 * - {@see self::OFF} — neither.
 *
 * The SPA maps these onto the addon's `autoCloseTags` option (`true`,
 * `{whenOpening: false}`, `false`). An on/off toggle would have had to make
 * "off" mean "off, except for the `</` completion", which is a lie a label
 * cannot carry.
 *
 * Mirrors {@see SlashToolsService}'s shape — the `settings` table is a generic
 * key/value store, so a new preference needs no migration.
