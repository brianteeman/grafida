/**
 * Raised when an article's category carries **required** custom fields of a type
 * Grafida does not support. Joomla's API validates a write against the article
 * edit form, so a required field with no value is a hard 400 — Grafida stops
 * first, with a message the user can act on.
 *
 * It is raised in two distinguishable situations (gh-59), because only one of
 * them is a dead end:
 *
 * - **Blocking** (`fieldLabels` non-empty): there is at least one required
 *   unsupported field Grafida holds no value for — typically a brand-new
 *   article. Nothing could be sent for it, so the only way out is Joomla's own
 *   back-end; the UI offers the article HTML to copy across.
 * - **Overridable** (`fieldLabels` empty, `overridableLabels` non-empty): every
 *   required unsupported field carries the value read off the site when the
 *   article was imported, so re-sending those values verbatim satisfies the
 *   form. `canForce()` is true and the publish can be retried with `$force`.
 *   It is not done silently: a value Grafida cannot display is also one it
 *   cannot show to be stale, so the user confirms it.
