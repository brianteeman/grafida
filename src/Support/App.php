     * binary; upstream builds it on the latest runner with no `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`,
     * so it is linked `minos 15.0` against a libc++ symbol that simply does not exist on
     * earlier systems. On anything older the library cannot be loaded at all and the app dies
     * inside `FFI::cdef()` (gh-58).
     *
     * Three consumers: {@see \Grafida\Startup\StartupCheck} (the runtime pre-flight),
     * `scripts/make-macos-app.sh` (`LSMinimumSystemVersion`, read out of this file with sed),
     * and `DylibDeploymentTargetTest`, which fails the suite if the shipped library's floor
     * ever rises above this value. Re-check on every boson-php bump with
     * `vtool -show-build vendor/boson-php/saucer/bin/libboson-darwin-universal.dylib`.
