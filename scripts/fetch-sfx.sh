# Download the patched sibling-payload micro.sfx runtimes into build/sfx/.
#
# The binaries are built by GitHub Actions on the nikosdion/phpmicro fork
# (branch sibling-phar, workflow build-sfx.yml) and published as assets of the
# rolling "sfx-latest" release. With them in place, macOS builds become
# Developer-ID signable/notarisable — see build/readme/01-macos-signing.md.
#
# Usage:  scripts/fetch-sfx.sh [--force]
#   --force   re-download even when the file is already present
#
# Already-present files are kept (so a locally built SFX is never clobbered
# unless --force is given). A failed download leaves nothing behind; builds
# without build/sfx/ simply fall back to the stock (unsignable) Boson runtime.
