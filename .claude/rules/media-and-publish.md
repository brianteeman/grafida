# Media & publishing

The `src/Media/` and `src/Publish/PublishService.php` notes from `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Layout`
section, kept together because they are one pipeline: a picture pasted into an article is a
local blob until a publish uploads it and rewrites the HTML. Verbatim — the leading `- ` and
two-space continuation indent are the original bullet formatting.

- `src/Media/` — offline image blobs (`media_blobs`) + `SiteImageFetcher` (fetches a published
  article image for a multimodal AI request — see the AI facts). `ApiClient::listMedia()` browses the
  site's Media Manager (`GET /v1/media/files`); `ApiController` exposes it as
  `GET /api/sites/{id}/media?path=…` and serves an offline blob's data: URI back to the SPA
  via `GET /api/media/{id}` (to preview a not-yet-published intro/full-text image);
  `GET /api/media/{id}/target` answers where that blob will be published (gh-72, see the
  "Image URL" note under `src/Publish/` below).
  ⚠️ **A pasted/dropped/picked image is no longer inlined as a `data:` URI in the article body**
  (gh-36): `MediaRepository` still stores the bytes in `media_blobs` (now also carrying
  `updated_at`/`width`/`height`/`size`, added by `storage/migrations/07_media_blobs_local.sql` —
  not re-runnable, following the `04_ai_chat_response_chain.sql` pattern), but the editor
  references it by a **local URL the Boson kernel itself serves**:
  `boson://app/api/media/{id}/raw?rev=<token>` (`MediaController::mediaBlobRaw()`, ~60 bytes
  regardless of image size, vs. a 2.3 MiB screenshot's ~3.1 MiB of base64 previously sitting in
  the editor DOM, `State` *and* the `drafts.html` column — which is what made the CodeMirror
  source editor freeze for seconds on a couple of pasted screenshots). `rev` is this endpoint's
  analogue of `mediaDisplayUrl()`'s `grafida_rev` (gh-4): a blob's bytes can be replaced in place
  by the Local Media tab's image editor, so the URL must change on every edit or the webview's
  disk cache paints the old picture — except here the token is derived
  (`Grafida\Media\LocalMediaUrl::token()`, `sha1($revisedAt . '|' . $id)` truncated to 8 chars,
  `$revisedAt` = `updated_at ?? created_at`) rather than looked up from Joomla's own metadata,
  since there is no Joomla record yet. `LocalMediaUrl::build(id, revisedAt)` is the **only** place
  either PHP or JS should construct this URL — mirrored byte-for-byte in JS by
  `assets/private/js/editor/localmedia.js`'s `window.GrafidaLocalMedia` (its own from-scratch
  synchronous SHA-1, since `window.crypto.subtle` is Promise-only and this runs inside a
  synchronous TinyMCE hook), an IIFE loaded in `index.html` right after `app.js` alongside
  `slashtools.js`/`csstheme.js`. The endpoint answers **raw bytes, not JSON** — the only route in
  the app that does — with `Content-Type` restricted to a small allow-list
  (`MediaController::ALLOWED_RAW_MIME_TYPES`), `Content-Disposition: inline`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and, like every other internal-API response (gh-35),
  `Cache-Control: no-store`. `GET /api/media/{id}` (the JSON data:-URI form above) still exists
  for the AI panel's per-image fetch and the intro/full-text preview cache — only the *article
  body* stopped using it. A **Local Media tab** on the Media Manager screen
  (`GET /api/sites/{id}/local-media`, works offline) lists every not-yet-published blob — filename,
  dimensions, size, which local draft (if any) uses it, and a "Published" badge once `remote_url`
  is set — and offers the same in-app crop/resize/rotate/flip editor the Site Media tab's entries
  get (`openImageEditor()` now takes a small `{name, mime, loadDataUri(), save()}` descriptor so
  one implementation serves both tabs, and — since gh-43 — the article editor's own image
  context toolbar too, via `localMediaEditorDescriptorBase(entry, afterSave)`, which factors out
  everything but what happens after a successful save: the grid re-renders itself, an in-article
  edit has no grid on screen to touch), plus rename, save-to-disk
  (`POST /api/media/{id}/save-to-disk`, folder picker + server write, since Boson has no Save-As
  dialog) and delete.
  ⚠️ **Editing a blob's bytes in place leaves every `<img>` that references it wearing a stale,
  possibly-distorted `width`/`height`** (gh-43) — TinyMCE bakes the *intrinsic* size onto every
  inserted image (its paste/drop path inserts `<img width="…" height="…">`, and the Insert/Edit
  Image dialog auto-fills Dimensions from `naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight`), so a crop/resize
  changes the blob's real dimensions but nothing revisits the tag's already-baked-in attributes,
  and a plain `src` swap alone stretches/squashes the old picture into the old aspect ratio. The
  fix is one rule, `Grafida\Media\ImageDimensions::fit(attrW, attrH, oldW, oldH, newW, newH)` —
  see its doc comment (and `.plans/00-overview.md`'s truth table) for the exact cases: no
  attributes → leave alone; the tag's size still matches the blob's *old* intrinsic size (never
  hand-resized) → adopt the new intrinsic size wholesale; otherwise a deliberate in-article size →
  keep the attribute that is present and re-ratio the other so the picture is never distorted;
  any dimension unknown → leave alone — **implemented twice, and the two must stay in step**:
  `ImageDimensions::fit()` in PHP and `assets/private/js/editor/localmedia.js`'s
  `GrafidaLocalMedia.fitDimensions()` in JS (same argument order, same rounding), because the rule
  has to apply in two different runtimes. The **server** half runs even with the article
  **closed** — the reported bug crops a blob from the Local Media tab, then reopens an article
  that never had TinyMCE running to fix itself — via `Grafida\Media\LocalMediaSync::resync()`
  (a container-registered service, `DraftRepository::listReferencingMedia()` finds every draft on
  the blob's site whose `html` LIKEs its `…/media/{id}/raw` URL) calling
  `Html\InlineMedia::resyncLocalImage()`, which walks every matching `<img>` (matched the same
  tolerant way `rewriteOfflineImages()` is — by `src` or by the `data-grafida-media-id` tag,
  whichever resolves), rewrites `src` to the freshly built URL and applies `ImageDimensions::fit()`
  to `width`/`height`, and returns the HTML byte-identical when nothing matched so an unaffected
  draft is never even written back (`DraftRepository::updateHtml()` bumps `updated_at`, since the
  rendered content genuinely changed). `MediaController::updateLocalMediaContent()` captures the
  blob's *old* width/height **before** `replaceData()` overwrites them, calls `resync()` with old
  + new, and now answers `{id, url, width, height, oldWidth, oldHeight}` — the two `old*` fields
  are additive, purely so the **live** half, `refreshLocalMediaReferences(id, result)` in
  `app.js`, can run the identical rule against an **already-open** editor's DOM (one undo step:
  every `img[data-grafida-media-id="N"]`'s `src` *and*, via `fitDimensions()`, `width`/`height`)
  without a second round trip to fetch them. `GET /api/media/{id}` (`mediaBlob()`) grew the same
  way — additively — from `{id, dataUri}` to `{id, dataUri, filename, mime, width, height}`: the
  AI panel's per-image fetch and the intro/full-text preview cache only ever read `dataUri`, so
  they are unaffected, while the new fields let a caller (the context toolbar's **Edit image**
  item, below) build an image-editor descriptor without a second request.
  **Legacy drafts** (saved before gh-36, still carrying real `data:` images in `html`) are
  converted the first time they are opened: `DraftController::getDraft()` runs
  `Grafida\Media\InlineImageExtractor::extract()`, which decodes each `data:` image into a fresh
  `media_blobs` row and rewrites the `<img>` to the local URL (persisted back to the draft only
  when it already has an id — an unsaved draft stays unsaved, matching the rest of the editor's
  save model). `InlineImageExtractor::storeDataUri()` is the shared decode-and-store primitive;
  `PublishService`'s own untagged-`data:`-image path (see below) calls the same method rather than
  duplicating it.
  **Media Manager screen** — a sidebar item (`data-screen="media"`) split into two tabs, modelled
  on the Articles screen's tab strip: **Site Media** (below) and **Local Media** (above). Site
  Media is the full online manager for the site's Media Manager and works only while the site is
  connected — that "not connected" guard is now scoped to its own tab panel rather than blanking
  the whole screen, since Local Media works offline regardless. The SPA
  (`loadMediaScreen()` in `app.js`) seeds the root from `GET /api/sites/{id}/media/adapters`
  (the first adapter is the default filesystem; its `path` like `local-images:/` is the root),
  browses folders with the existing `browseMedia`, and renders a card grid (folders + **all**
  files, not only images) with breadcrumb navigation and an adapter switcher when >1 filesystem
  exists. Actions map onto com_media's REST CRUD (verified against 5.4 source — see Joomla API
  facts): upload (`POST …/media/files` → `ApiClient::uploadMedia` with `override`), create folder
  (`POST …/media/folder` → `createMediaFolder`, a POST with a path but no content), rename
  (`POST …/media/rename` → `renameMedia`, a PATCH on the item URL whose body carries the new
  path; the server derives the new path from the old so the item stays in its folder), delete
  (`DELETE …/media?path=…` → `deleteMedia`), and an in-app **image editor** (crop/resize/rotate/
  flip on a `<canvas>`, saved via `POST …/media/content` → `updateMediaContent`, a PATCH that
  sends the same path + new base64 content). The editor loads the source bytes through the
  backend (`GET …/media/file` → `getMediaFile`, returning a data: URI) so the canvas is **not**
  tainted by a cross-origin `<img>` (which would block `toBlob`); it only opens raster types
  (`png`/`jpg`/`jpeg`/`webp`). PATCH/DELETE put the adapter-qualified path in the **URL segment**
  (`v1/media/files/:path`, route pattern `.*`), so `ApiClient::mediaItemUrl()` keeps `/` and `:`
  literal and percent-encodes the rest.
  **Crop is a mode, so arming it has to be visible without moving the mouse** (gh-31). It used to
  change nothing but the stage's `cursor`, which only shows once you happen to hover the image, so
  the button read as inert. `updateCropUi()` is now the single place that renders crop state, and it
  drives four signals at once: the stage gets an accent ring, an `.img-editor-prompt` scrim dims the
  image behind a "drag a rectangle" instruction, the button flips to **Cancel crop** (label *and*
  icon, via `setIconBtnLabel()` — colour alone is not an accessible state cue, and `aria-pressed`
  carries it to assistive tech), and the statusbar hint stops being muted advice and becomes live
  state. Once a rectangle exists the prompt hides — the selection box's own 9999px scrim takes over
  as the highlight — and the hint turns into a `GRAFIDA_LBL_CROP_SELECTION` readout of the selection
  in **source** pixels (`sel` is in *display* pixels, so it is divided by `State.imgEditorScale`).
  Apply crop is `disabled` until the selection is usable, since applying a zero-sized one silently
  did nothing; a bare click (which leaves exactly that) clears the selection so the prompt returns.
  ⚠️ **Every `<img>` showing a Media Manager entry must go through `mediaDisplayUrl(entry)`, never the
  bare `entry.url`.** Joomla returns the plain static file URL, so after an in-app edit rewrites the file
  the webview keeps painting its cached copy — the crop *does* save and the image editor shows it (those
  bytes arrive through PHP via `getMediaFile`, which no browser cache sees), while the card thumbnail and
  the preview still show the picture as it was (gh-4). The helper stamps the entry's `modified_date` onto
  the URL as a `grafida_rev` parameter, so each revision is a distinct URL. It is **display-only**: what a
  media pick contributes to an *article* (`browseImageMedia()`, the TinyMCE `file_picker_callback`) stays
  the bare `url`, or the cache-buster would be published into the article HTML.

- `src/Publish/PublishService.php` — the publish pipeline (media upload, tags, fields, split, POST/PATCH).
  ⚠️ **The required-unsupported guard is no longer a dead end, and `$force` is not a "skip the
  checks" switch** (gh-59). `guardRequiredUnsupportedFields()` asks `FieldSupport::requiredUnsupported()`
  to split the required fields of a type Grafida cannot edit in two, by whether the draft holds a
  value for them:
  - **blocking** — nothing we could send. `PublishBlockedException` with `canForce() === false`; the
    SPA offers only *Copy article HTML*, with **Publish anyway** rendered **disabled** rather than
    omitted (an absent button reads as "this build cannot do it" instead of "not for this article").
  - **overridable** — the draft carries the value `ArticleController::remoteFieldValues()` imported
    when the article was opened from the site. `canForce()` is true, and a retry with `force: true`
    (`POST /api/drafts/{id}/publish` body) sends those values back **verbatim** — `mapFields()` has a
    `$carried` list it passes straight through, ahead of the supported-type filter, because Grafida
    does not understand the shape and must not reinterpret it.
  Three things this rests on, none of them guessable from the code:
  - **The confirmation is not ceremony.** Grafida cannot render such a value, so it cannot show that
    its copy has gone stale on the site since the article was imported. That is the only reason this
    is a dialog and not an automatic re-send.
  - ⚠️ **Only the *required* ones are ever carried.** An omitted `com_fields` key does **not** clear
    a field over the API: `plg_system_fields::onContentAfterSave()` falls back to the stored
    `rawvalue`, and the `$data->com_fields[$name] = false` blanking everyone remembers comes from
    `onContentNormaliseRequestData`, which only `FormController` fires — **the API controller never
    does**. So leaving an optional unsupported field out is strictly safer than overwriting it with
    our snapshot, and widening `$carried` to all of them would be a regression, not a courtesy.
  - **A `subform`'s member fields need no special case.** `subform` is itself an unsupported type,
    so a required one is already caught; its members are assigned `-1` ("Only Use In Subform") and
    `FieldCategoryScope` drops them before the guard ever sees them.
  ⚠️ **A publish can still be rejected by the site, and that is expected, not exceptional.** The
  guard is checked against the *cached* field definitions, so a field added, renamed or made
  required since the last metadata refresh is invisible to it. Joomla answers with a 400
  (`InvalidParameterException` out of `ApiController::save()`'s `$model->validate()`), which reaches
  the SPA as `{code: 'joomla_api', status: 400}`; `showPublishRejectedDialog()` keeps the site's own
  message (it names the offending field — nothing else identifies it) and offers **Reload metadata**.
  Every write carries a `version_note` — `GRAFIDA_MSG_VERSION_NOTE` ("Created using %1$s %2$s",
  filled from `App::NAME`/`App::VERSION`) — so a revision names the tool that wrote it in Joomla's
  version history (gh-17; see the Joomla API facts for the `jform` mechanism that carries it and
  why a site with history off silently drops it). It is translated with
  `LanguageService::translateIn()` into the **article's** language (`$draft->language`), not the
  interface one: it is read on the site, beside the article it describes. This is the codebase's
  only server-side-translated string.
  After a successful publish the SPA (`showPostPublishDialog()`) asks what to do with the local
  draft: **Delete Local Article** (the default/focused action — removes the draft and returns to the list,
  the published article remaining in the remote list) or **Keep Local Article** (leaves the editor open to
  edit and re-publish). A draft's `images` object holds Joomla's eight `image_intro*` / `image_fulltext*` subfields; the
  intro/full-text image picked from a local file is stored as a `grafida-media://N` sentinel that
  `resolveImages()` uploads (via the shared offline-blob upload) and swaps for a public URL on publish.
  The SPA's editor "Images" section lets you pick a local file, browse the site's media, or paste a URL,
  and includes Joomla's `image_*_alt_empty` "decorative image" toggle.
  ⚠️ **The "Image URL" box is one control with two modes, and `buildImagePathGroup()` is the single
  implementation of both** — the Images section and the `media` custom field share it (gh-72). With a
  hand-typed or site-media value it is an ordinary editable input, which is the only way to reference a
  picture served from outside the Media Manager (a CDN, which is why the field is editable at all).
  With a `grafida-media://N` sentinel it is **read-only**, filled from `GET /api/media/{id}/target`
  (cached in `State.mediaTargets`) with the path the blob is *expected* to be published under, and
  carries an ⓘ button explaining that. Three things about it:
  - **Read-only is not a nicety.** What the box shows is not the stored value — the sentinel is — so an
    edit would swap a picture that exists for a path that does not. Clearing the picture is how the
    field becomes typeable again.
  - **It fixes a usability bug, not a missing feature** (Brian Teeman's report): the box used to render
    *blank* for a local pick, making it the first thing on the panel you could type into after
    choosing a picture — so alt text kept landing in it.
  - **The cache must be dropped wherever the answer can change**: a Local Media rename (the file name
    is part of the path) and a successful publish (every prediction has just become a real path).
    A crop/resize does not change it.
  ⚠️ **`browseImageMedia()` must honour `picked.mediaId`.** The media browser's Local Media tab resolves
  with an offline blob, whose `url` is the local `boson://…/media/{id}/raw` one; adopting that as the
  image value publishes it verbatim and the picture is broken on the site. It has to become the same
  `grafida-media://N` sentinel the "Choose file…" button produces — which the `media` custom field's own
  browse button always did and this one did not.
  The same picker backs TinyMCE's
  Insert/Edit Image dialog: its Source-field browse button (`file_picker_callback`, gated by
  `file_picker_types: 'image'`) opens the media browser, with a "Choose file…" button for a local file.
  To **edit an already-inserted image** (dimensions, description, alignment, CSS), selecting it shows a
  floating context toolbar (`addContextToolbar('grafidaImageTools')`, predicate = `img`) whose **Image**
  item re-opens that same dialog; the dialog carries the Dimensions fields (`image_dimensions`), an
  Advanced tab (`image_advtab`: inline style, border, spacing) and — via `a11y_advanced_options: true`,
  matching Joomla's own editor — an **"Image is decorative"** checkbox that empties the alt text and
  marks the image with an empty `alt` so a screen reader skips it (gh-5). This is the inline-image
  counterpart of the intro/full-text images' `image_*_alt_empty` toggle. Double-clicking the image or the
  toolbar/Insert-menu **Image** button work too. The same context toolbar's **CSS class…** item
  (`imageclass` button) opens a small prompt to set any free-text CSS class(es) on the image (the
  Insert/Edit Image dialog has no class field); it pre-fills the current `class` and writes it back in one
  undo step (empty clears it). The toolbar gained two more items in gh-43: **Edit image**
  (`localimageedit`) reopens the same crop/resize/rotate/flip editor the Media Manager's Local
  Media tab uses (see `src/Media/` above) on the selected `<img>`'s own blob, so a picture pasted
  straight into the article can be touched up without leaving it; it is enabled only when the
  selected node resolves to a **local** blob id — read the self-healing way the tagging hook
  already does (the `data-grafida-media-id` attribute first, falling back to parsing the id out of
  the local URL) — so a site-media or external `<img>` (neither) leaves the button disabled rather
  than doing nothing on click. **Reset size** (`resetsize`) restores the selected `<img>`'s
  `width`/`height` to its own decoded `naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` — the issue's secondary
  complaint, "no way to reset the dimensions" — and is deliberately generic (it reads the
  *displayed* image, no fetch needed) so it works for a local blob, a published site-media image
  or an external URL alike, unlike Edit image which only makes sense for a local one.
  ⚠️ **All three of those items live on the right-click menu as well, and that is the route users
  actually take** — the floating toolbar alone was rightly called unusable: it only appears once the
  image is *selected*, and right-clicking an unselected image opens the context menu instead, so
  reaching **Edit image** meant right-click → Escape → click → toolbar. They are therefore also
  registered as a `grafidaimage` **context-menu section** (`addContextMenu`) and the `contextmenu`
  init option is set to `'link image grafidaimage table'` so the section renders directly below the
  stock **Image** item. Two things follow from that: each action is a plain function taking the
  `<img>` it acts on (`promptImageClass`/`editLocalImage`/`resetImageSize` in `initTinyMCE()`'s
  `setup`) rather than reading `editor.selection.getNode()` itself, since the context menu hands its
  `update()` the clicked element outright; and because `update()` re-runs per right-click with that
  element in hand, **Edit image** is simply *omitted* there for a non-local image, where the toolbar
  button — registered once, for every image — has to be shown disabled instead. Setting
  `contextmenu` explicitly **replaces** the stock list rather than extending it (same trap as
  `menu.tools` and `help_tabs`); the names dropped from it — `linkchecker`, `editimage`,
  `spellchecker`, `configurepermanentpen` — are all premium plugins Grafida does not load, and an
  unregistered section is skipped anyway, so listing them would only imply we ship them.
  The editor `content_style` also forces
  `img { max-width: 100%; height: auto }`: Joomla bakes a photo's full intrinsic size into the tag (e.g.
  `width="4032"`), and without a constraining rule the picture overflows the editor's scroll box and becomes
  un-clickable in the WKWebView (broken hit-testing) — scaling it to fit keeps it selectable/editable, and
  only the editor view is affected (the published `width`/`height` are untouched).
  The `content_style` likewise forces `body { margin: 0; padding: 1rem }` so the editing surface always has
  breathing room (gh-23): TinyMCE's built-in content CSS carries `body{margin:1rem}`, but that CSS is loaded
  **only when the site supplies no `editor.css`** (`content_css` is the site stylesheet otherwise), so a site
  `editor.css` that sets no body spacing — e.g. Bootstrap's Reboot `body{margin:0}`, where the real front-end
  pads the article via wrapper containers Grafida's editor has no equivalent of — leaves the text flush against
  the iframe edge and the focus ring clipping the first characters. `content_style` is injected after
  `content_css` so it applies in both branches; the `margin:0` keeps the inset a uniform 1rem rather than
  doubling to 2rem in the built-in-CSS branch. Editor-only, like the `img` rule — `editor.css` never reaches
  the published article.
  TinyMCE's own **"Upload" tab is disabled** (`image_uploadtab: false`) because its "Browse for an image"
  dropzone creates a plain `<input type="file">` that Boson's webview never opens (see the native
  file-dialog note in `CLAUDE.md`) — so local uploads go exclusively through the Source-field "Choose file…",
  which calls the native picker. The **quickbars insert toolbar is disabled** for the same reason
  (`quickbars_insert_toolbar: false`, gh-6): the toolbar it pops up on every empty line offers a
  `quickimage` button that clicks that same dead `<input type="file">`. The `quickbars` plugin stays
  loaded — its selection and image context toolbars are unaffected.
  A **`media` custom field** carries the same `grafida-media://N` sentinel, and for the same reason —
  Grafida's media browser can pick a picture that is still local — so `resolveMediaField()` resolves
  it through the very same `uploadBlob()`, and follows `resolveImages()`'s rule for a blob that has
  since been deleted: **drop the reference**, because publishing `grafida-media://5` as a `src` on a
  live site is worse than an empty field. (An upload that *fails* still aborts the publish, as
  everywhere else — `uploadBlob()` returns null only for a blob that is not there any more; this is
  deliberately *not* the inline-body-image rule, which aborts, because a sidebar image reference and
  an image embedded in the prose fail differently.) Where an intro image's resolved value is the bare
  relative `src`, a media field's is the full value **Joomla's own media field would hold** —
  `images/x.jpg#joomlaImage://local-images/x.jpg?width=800&height=600` (`joomlaImageValue()`) — since
  `HTMLHelper::cleanImageURL()` reads that fragment to give the rendered `<img>` its `width`/`height`
  and `loading="lazy"`. ⚠️ The fragment is emitted **only when the upload response gave an
  adapter-qualified path** (com_media's `getFile()` prefixes every path it returns with `<adapter>:`),
  because without one we would be naming an adapter we guessed at; the value is perfectly valid
  without it, the site just renders no dimensions. The record shape itself — and why a partial one is
  no save at all — is `Field\MediaFieldValue`'s; see `CLAUDE.md`'s `src/Field/` bullet.
  a local pick is inserted as `<img src="boson://app/api/media/{id}/raw?rev=…"
  data-grafida-media-id="N">` (`GRAFIDA_MEDIA_ATTR`, mirroring `InlineMedia::ATTRIBUTE`) — **not**
  a `data:` URI (gh-36, see `src/Media/` above) — so `PublishService` uploads the referenced blob
  on publish; a site-media pick is inserted as its public URL. The tagging attribute is
  self-healing rather than trusted blindly: a `SetContent`/`NodeChange` hook derives the id from
  the `<img>`'s own `src` first (`localMediaIdFromUrl()`, parsing the local URL — this is what
  survives a save/reload/import) and only falls back to a same-session `State.inlineMediaByUri`
  map for a `data:` image that has not been tagged yet, so the attribute is never the *only* place
  the id is remembered. On publish, `InlineMedia::rewriteOfflineImages()` rewrites **every**
  offline image, in **either** form — local-URL or `data:` — not just tagged ones: an image
  **pasted or dropped straight into the editor** on a platform/path that still lands as a bare
  `<img src="data:...">` with no tag (or a draft saved before gh-36) never passes through the
  in-editor upload handler, so it carries no `data-grafida-media-id`;
  `PublishService::uploadInlineImage()` decodes and stores such an untagged `data:` URI on the fly
  (via `InlineImageExtractor::storeDataUri()`, the same primitive the legacy-draft migration uses)
  so it is uploaded too, instead of leaking a giant broken inline blob into the published HTML. A
  local-URL image whose blob has since been **deleted** (Local Media tab, or the DB was reset) is
  a distinct failure from an untagged `data:` image: there is no fallback data to fall back to, so
  it aborts the publish with a dedicated `ApiException` — a plain-English literal like every other
  message in this class (none of them run through `LanguageService::translateIn()`, which is
  reserved for site-facing strings like `version_note`) — rather than publishing a broken
  `boson://` src that resolves to nothing on the live site. Any other media upload that fails (or
  returns no usable result) aborts the publish with a clear error too.
  Each uploaded image is rebuilt as the **same `<img>` Joomla's own media field emits** —
  `<img src="images/…" width=… height=… loading="lazy" data-path="local-images:/…">` (`mediaInfo()`): a
  site-root-relative `src`, the intrinsic `width`/`height`, and the `data-path` adapter linkage to the
  Media-Manager entry. **The upload path names its adapter and is relative to that adapter's root**
  (`local-images:/grafida/<file>`, NOT `images/grafida/<file>`): the `local-images` adapter *is* the
  site's `images/` directory, so an `images/`-prefixed path writes the file to
  `images/images/grafida/…` while the article still points at `images/grafida/…` — a broken image.
  ⚠️ **Naming the adapter is not decoration — leaving it out is gh-57.** A colon-less path is
  resolved by `ProviderManagerHelperTrait::getDefaultAdapterName()` against `local-` + com_media's
  **`file_path`** parameter, which `base.sql` stores as `files` on every stock install, and
  `plg_filesystem_local` ships adapters for both `images` and `files` — so the default really is
  `local-files`, and only a site that has *removed* the `files` adapter falls through to the
  "first available local adapter" the old comment here assumed was the rule. (Joomla's own image
  fields — `MediaField`, TinyMCE's upload dir — read the *other* parameter, `image_path` = `images`.)
  `Media\MediaUploadTarget` owns the decision now: the per-site `media_adapter` / `media_folder`
  settings (migration `09`, the Sites form's "Upload images to" / "Upload folder") when set,
  otherwise `local-images` if the site reports it, else the first adapter it reports. Three
  properties of it are load-bearing: automatic resolution is **memoised per site** (else it is one
  `media/adapters` request *per uploaded image*), it degrades to the **empty prefix** — i.e.
  pre-gh-57 behaviour — when the adapters cannot be listed at all (an unreachable site or a token
  without the rights must still publish), and `mediaInfo()`'s last-resort `src` therefore runs the
  sent path through `publicPath()` rather than using it raw, since that path may now carry an
  adapter. After a successful media upload `PublishService`
  also **writes the rewritten HTML back into the local draft** (so the stored draft mirrors what was
  published and a re-publish does not upload the images again); `data-path` is added to the editor's
  `extended_valid_elements` so it survives a TinyMCE round-trip.

## `tests/corpus/` — the round-trip conformance corpus

The publish pipeline's two purely deterministic halves — `Html\ContentSplitter` and the
body-building half of `Publish\PublishService` — decide what an article *is* on someone's live
website. Until this corpus existed nothing anywhere asserted their behaviour on arbitrary HTML;
it was pinned only by a handful of `assertStringContainsString()` calls on hand-written snippets.

⚠️ **The corpus is written in a language-neutral format on purpose: it is the contract a second
implementation is written against, not a PHP fixture.** Grafida's iPad app parses the same article
bodies with WebKit's HTML5 parser rather than PHP's, so "does it agree with the desktop app" has to
be an executable question, answerable without running PHP. Anything that would make a case readable
only from PHP — a serialised object, a PHP-callable in a fixture, a case that depends on
`App::VERSION` — defeats the point of it existing.

`Tests\Unit\ConformanceCorpusTest` runs every case; `Tests\Unit\Support\CorpusRunner` is the harness
both it and any regeneration tooling go through.

### One directory per case

```
tests/corpus/<case-name>/
    input.html              REQUIRED  the article body as it arrives
    expected-intro.html     REQUIRED  introtext after ContentSplitter
    expected-full.html      optional  fulltext after ContentSplitter
    expected-body.json      REQUIRED  the flat top-level JSON object PublishService POSTs/PATCHes
    expected-request.json   optional  { "method": "POST"|"PATCH", "path": "/v1/content/articles[/id]" }
    meta.json               REQUIRED  { "description": "...", "source": "gh-57" | "real article" | ... }
    draft.json              optional  partial override of the standard draft
    site-fields.json        optional  the custom field definitions the site reports
    site-tags.json          optional  the tags the site already has
```

Seven rules, none of them guessable from the files:

- **Every `.html` file carries exactly one trailing newline, which is not part of the value.**
  `CorpusRunner::read()` strips a single `\n` from the end of `input.html` and of both
  `expected-*.html`, so the round trip through the filesystem adds nothing to either side and git
  still gets newline-terminated files. A second implementation must strip the same one newline.
- ⚠️ **An absent `expected-full.html` means "no read-more marker", which is not the same statement
  as an empty fulltext** — the file is omitted rather than written empty, so the two cases stay
  distinguishable by looking at the directory. The test compares against `''` either way.
- ⚠️ **`expected-body.json` omits `version_note`.** It is built from `App::VERSION`, so keeping it
  would make every expectation stale on the next release while saying nothing about how the
  *content* is built. That it is sent at all is pinned by gh-17's own tests, not here.
- **`draft.json` is a partial override of one standard draft** (`CorpusRunner::DRAFT_DEFAULTS`):
  title `Corpus article`, alias `corpus-article`, catid `2`, access `1`, state `1`, language
  `en-GB`, everything else empty, `remoteId` null. A case is about the *body*; anything it does not
  mention must not vary between cases. Setting `remoteId` is what turns the write into a PATCH.
- ⚠️ **No case may need the network.** The publish runs against a `FakeTransport` answering exactly
  one URL — the article write — so a case must not contain an offline image (`boson://` or `data:`),
  and must not name a tag that `site-tags.json` does not already carry, or the publish will try to
  upload/create it and the case will fail with a 404 rather than a useful diff. That is a deliberate
  fence: media upload and tag creation are network behaviour and belong in their own tests.
- **A case that exercises the *parser* needs a read-more marker in it.** `ContentSplitter::split()`
  returns `trim($html)` **byte-identical** when there is no marker — it never parses at all — so a
  tree-construction or serialisation case written without one silently asserts nothing. (That
  fast path is itself a documented property, pinned by `no-marker-is-untouched`.)
- **`meta.json`'s `description` is the argument for the case**, in a sentence, and `source` says
  where the HTML came from (`gh-NN`, `real article`, `Word paste`, `WHATWG tree construction`, …).
  `ConformanceCorpusTest::testCaseIsWellFormed()` enforces both, because a case nobody can argue
  about later is a case that will eventually be regenerated to make a suite green.

### Changing an expectation

⚠️ **A failing case is a question, not a file to regenerate.** The whole value of the corpus is
that it says what the two implementations must agree on; bulk-rewriting the expectations to match
whatever the code now does converts it into a description of the current bug. Read the diff, decide
which output is *more correct* (the spec and what a browser renders are the tie-breakers, not what
the code used to do), and change the one expectation with the reason in the commit message. If the
new output really is better, the iPad implementation has to change with it — which is exactly the
conversation the corpus exists to force.
